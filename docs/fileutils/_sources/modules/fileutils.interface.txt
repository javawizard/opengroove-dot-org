.. module:: fileutils.interface
   :synopsis: Abstract classes.



--------------
Class BaseFile
--------------

An abstract class representing an absolute path to a file on a particular
FileSystem instance.

Instances of this class can be obtained from FileSystem.child(). They can
also be obtained from FileSystem.roots, a property providing a list of all
of the file system's root directories.

.. class:: BaseFile

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: __div__(self, other)

      An absolutely pointless and unnecessary alias for self.child(other)
      that exists solely because I was overly bored one night while working
      on fileutils.

   .. method:: ancestor_of(self, other, including_self=False)

      Returns true if this file is an ancestor of the specified file. A file
      is an ancestor of another file if that other file's parent is (as
      decided by :obj:`~same_as`) this file, or its parent's parent is this
      file, and so on.

      If including_self is True, the file is considered to be an ancestor of
      itself, i.e. True will be returned in the case that self.same_as(other).
      Otherwise, only the file's immediate parent, and its parent's parent,
      and so on are considered to be ancestors.

   .. attribute:: ancestors

      A list of all of the ancestors of this file, with self.parent first.

      This property simply returns
      :obj:`self.get_ancestors() <get_ancestors>`. Have a look at that
      method if you need to do more complex things like include self as one
      of the returned ancestors.

   .. method:: append(self, data)

      Append the specified data to the end of this file.

   .. attribute:: as_working

      A property that returns a context manager. This context manager sets
      the working directory to self upon being entered and restores it to
      what it previously was upon being exited. One can use this to replace
      something like::

          old_dir = File()
          new_dir.cd()
          try:
              ...stuff...
          finally:
              old_dir.cd()

      with the much nicer::

          with new_dir.as_working:
              ...stuff...

      and get exactly the same effect.

      The context manager's __enter__ returns self (this file), so you can
      also use an "as" clause on the with statement to get access to the
      file in case you haven't got it stored in a variable anywhere.

   .. attribute:: attributes

      This is the new attributes system. It's highly experimental, so beware
      that it might not work as expected and that its API could change
      without notice. More to come.

   .. method:: cd(self)

      An alias for :obj:`self.change_to() <change_to>`.

   .. method:: change_to(self)

      Sets the current working directory to self.

      Since File instances internally store paths in absolute form, other
      File instances will continue to work just fine after this is called.

      If you need to restore the working directory at any point, you might
      want to consider using :obj:`self.as_working <as_working>` instead.

   .. method:: check_file(self)

      Checks to see whether this File refers to a file. If it doesn't, an
      exception will be thrown.

   .. method:: check_folder(self)

      Checks to see whether this File refers to a folder. If it doesn't, an
      exception will be thrown.

   .. method:: child(self, *names)

      Returns a file object representing the child of this file with the
      specified name. If multiple names are present, they will be joined
      together. If no names are present, self will be returned.

      If any names are absolute, all names before them (and self) will be
      discarded. Relative names (like "..") are also allowed. If you want a
      method that guarantees that the result is a child of self, use
      self.safe_child(...).

      This method is analogous to
      :obj:`os.path.join(self.path, *names) <os.path.join>`.

   .. attribute:: child_names

      A list of the names of all of the children of this file, as a list of
      strings. If this file is not a folder, the value of this property is
      None.

   .. attribute:: children

      A list of all of the children of this file, as a list of File objects.
      If this file is not a folder, the value of this property is None.

   .. method:: copy_attributes_to(self, other, which_attributes={})

      Copy file/directory attributes from self to other.

      which_attributes is a dictionary indicating which attribute sets are
      to be copied. The keys are subclasses of AttributeSet (these are class
      objects themselves, not instances of said classes) and the values
      indicate whether, and how, attribute sets are to be copied:

          True indicates that the attribute set in question should be copied.
          The copying will be performed with the attribute set's copy_to
          method.
          
          False indicates that the attribute set in question should not be
          copied.
          
          A two-argument function can be used to copy attributes in a custom
          manner. The function will be called with the source attribute set
          as the first argument and the target attribute set as the second
          argument.

      One additional key, None, can be specified. Its value indicates
      whether, and how, all attribute sets not explicitly specified in the
      dictionary are to be copied. If not specified, each attribute set's
      copy_by_default property is used to decide whether or not to copy that
      attribute set.

      To copy POSIX permissions and mode bits only, and nothing else, one
      could use::

          foo.copy_attributes_to(bar, {PosixPermissions: True, None: False})

      To skip copying of POSIX permissions and mode bits but copy everything
      else, one could use::

          foo.copy_attributes_to(bar, {PosixPermissions: False})

      To copy only the extended attribute "user.foo", one could use::

          def copy_user_foo(source, target):
              target.set("user.foo", source.get("user.foo"))
          foo.copy_attributes_to(bar, {ExtendedAttributes: copy_user_foo,
                                       None: False})

      (This example would be easier written as::

          bar.attributes[ExtendedAttributes].set("user.foo,
              foo.attributes[ExtendedAttributes].get("user.foo"))

      so take it as purely an example.)

   .. method:: copy_into(self, other, overwrite=False)

      Copies this file to an identically named file inside the specified
      folder. This is just shorthand for self.copy_to(other.child(self.name))
      which, from experience, seems to be by far the most common use case for
      the copy_to function.

      The newly-created file in the specified folder will be returned as per
      other.child(self.name).

   .. method:: copy_to(self, other, overwrite=False, dereference_links=True, attribute_sets=None)

      Copies the contents of this file to the specified file object. An
      exception will be thrown if the specified file already exists and
      overwrite is False.

      If dereference_links is True (the default), symbolic links encountered
      during copying will be dereferenced and their targets copied in their
      place. If dereference_links is False, such links will be recreated
      purely as symbolic links.

      This also does not currently preserve file attributes or permissions;
      such abilities will be added soon.

   .. method:: create_folder(self, ignore_existing=False, recursive=False)

      Creates the folder referred to by this File object. If it already
      exists but is not a folder, an exception will be thrown. If it already
      exists and is a folder, an exception will be thrown if ignore_existing
      is False (the default); if ignore_existing is True, no exception will
      be thrown.

      If the to-be-created folder's parent does not exist and recursive is
      False, an exception will be thrown. If recursive is True, the folder's
      parent, its parent's parent, and so on will be created automatically.

   .. method:: delete(self, ignore_missing=False)

      Deletes this file or folder, recursively deleting children if
      necessary.

      The contents parameter has no effect, and is present for backward
      compatibility.

      If the file does not exist and ignore_missing is False, an exception
      will be thrown. If the file does not exist but ignore_missing is True,
      this function simply does nothing.

      Note that symbolic links are never recursed into, and are instead
      themselves removed.

   .. method:: dereference(self, recursive=False)

      Dereference the symbolic link represented by this file and return a
      File object pointing to the symbolic link's referent.

      If recursive is False, a File object pointing directly to the referent
      will be returned. If recursive is True, the referent itself will be
      recursively dereferenced, and the returned File will be guaranteed not
      to be a link.

      If this file is not a symbolic link, self will be returned.

   .. method:: descendant_of(self, other, including_self=False)

      Returns true if this file is a descendant of the specified file. This
      is equivalent to other.ancestor_of(self, including_self).

   .. attribute:: exists

      True if this file/folder exists, False if it doesn't. This will be True
      even for broken symbolic links; use self.valid if you want an
      alternative that returns False for broken symbolic links.

   .. method:: get_ancestors(self, including_self=False)

      Returns a list of all of the ancestors of this file, with self.parent
      first. If including_self is True, self will be first, self.parent will
      be second, and so on.

   .. method:: get_path(self, relative_to=None, separator=None)

      Gets the path to the file represented by this File object.

      If relative_to is specified, the returned path will be a relative path,
      the path of this file relative to the specified one. Otherwise, the
      returned path will be absolute.

      If separator (which must be a string) is specified, it will be used as
      the separator to place between path components in the returned path.
      Otherwise, os.path.sep will be used as the separator.

   .. method:: get_path_components(self, relative_to=None)

      Returns a list of the components in this file's path, including (on
      POSIX-compliant systems) an empty leading component for absolute paths.

      If relative_to is specified, the returned set of components will
      represent a relative path, the path of this file relative to the
      specified one. Otherwise, the returned components will represent an
      absolute path.

   .. method:: hash(self, algorithm=<built-in function openssl_md5>, return_hex=True)

      Compute the hash of this file and return it, as a hexidecimal string.

      The default algorithm is md5. An alternate constructor from hashlib
      can be passed as the algorithm parameter; file.hash(hashlib.sha1)
      would, for example, compute the SHA-1 hash instead.

      If return_hex is False (it defaults to True), the hash object itself
      will be returned instead of the return value of its hexdigest() method.
      One can use this to access the binary hash instead.

   .. attribute:: is_broken

      True if this File is a symbolic link that is broken, False if it isn't.
      A symbolic link that points to a broken symbolic link is itself
      considered to be broken.

   .. attribute:: is_directory

      Same as self.is_folder.

   .. attribute:: is_file

      True if this File is a file, False if it isn't. If the file/folder
      doesn't actually exist yet, this will be False.

      If this file is a symbolic link that points to a file, this will be
      True.

   .. attribute:: is_folder

      True if this File is a folder, False if it isn't. If the file/folder
      doesn't actually exist yet, this will be False.

      If this file is a symbolic link that points to a folder, this will be
      True.

   .. attribute:: is_link

      True if this File is a symbolic link, False if it isn't. This will be
      True even for broken symbolic links.

   .. attribute:: is_mountpoint

      True if this File is a mount point, False if it isn't.

      This is just short for self.mountpoint.location == self.

   .. attribute:: link_target

      Returns the target to which this file, which is expected to be a
      symbolic link, points, as a string. If this file is not a symbolic
      link, None is returned.

      Subclasses (such as URL) without a well-defined notion of symbolic
      links are free to interpret this as they wish; URL, for example,
      presents as a link any URL which sends back an HTTP redirect.

   .. method:: link_to(self, target)

      Creates this file as a symbolic link pointing to other, which can be
      a pathname or an object of the same type as self. Note that if it's a
      pathname, a symbolic link will be created with the exact path
      specified; it will therefore be absolute if the path is absolute or
      relative (to the link itself) if the path is relative. If an object of
      the same type as self, however, is used, the symbolic link will always
      be absolute.

   .. method:: mkdir(self, silent=False)

      An alias for self.create_folder(ignore_existing=silent).

   .. method:: mkdirs(self, silent=False)
               makedirs(self, silent=False)

      An alias for self.create_folder(ignore_existing=silent, recursive=True).

   .. attribute:: mountpoint

      The MountPoint instance on which this file resides.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of this file. For example, File("a", "b", "c").name will be
      "c".

      On Unix-based operating systems, File("/").name will be the empty
      string.

   .. method:: open_for_reading(self)

      Open this file for reading in binary mode and return a Python file-like
      object from which this file's contents can be read.

   .. method:: open_for_writing(self, append=False)

      Open this file for reading in binary mode and return a Python file-like
      object from which this file's contents can be read.

      If append is False, the file's contents will be erased and the returned
      stream positioned at the beginning of the (now empty) file. If append
      is True, the file's contents will not be erased, and the returned
      stream will be positioned at the end of the file.

      Note that some implementations (e.g. SMBFile and FTPFile) don't have
      native support for writing files remotely; support in such
      implementations can be emulated by returning a wrapper around a
      temporary file that, when closed, uploads itself to the location of
      the file to be written. As a result, objects returned from
      open_for_writing should be closed before calling open_for_reading on
      the same file.

   .. attribute:: parent

      Returns a file representing the parent of this file. If this file has
      no parent (for example, if it's "/" on Unix-based operating systems or
      a drive letter on Windows), None will be returned.

   .. attribute:: path

      The absolute path to the file represented by this file object, in a
      format native to the type of file in use. For instances of
      fileutils.local.File, this pathname can be used with Python's
      traditional file-related utilities.

      This property simply returns self.get_path(). See the documentation for
      that method for more complex ways of creating paths (including
      obtaining relative paths).

   .. attribute:: path_components

      A property that simply returns
      :obj:`self.get_path_components() <get_path_components>`.

   .. method:: read(self)

      Read the contents of this file and return them as a string. This is
      usually a bad idea if the file in question is large, as the entire
      contents of the file will be loaded into memory.

   .. method:: read_blocks(self, block_size=None)

      A generator that yields successive blocks of data from this file. Each
      block will be no larger than block_size bytes, which defaults to 16384.
      This is useful when reading/processing files larger than would
      otherwise fit into memory.

      One could implement, for example, a copy function thus::

          with target.open("wb") as target_stream:
              for block in source.read_blocks():
                  target_stream.write(block)

   .. method:: recurse(self, filter=None, include_self=True, recurse_skipped=True)

      A generator that recursively yields all child File objects of this file.
      Files and directories (and the files and directories contained within
      them, and so on) are all included.

      A filter function accepting one argument can be specified. It will be
      called for each file and folder. It can return one of True, False,
      SKIP, YIELD, or RECURSE, with the behavior of each outlined in the
      following table::
          
                                Don't yield   Do yield
                              +-------------+----------+
          Don't recurse into  | SKIP        | YIELD    |
                              +-------------+----------+
          Do recurse into     | RECURSE     | True     |
                              +-------------+----------+
          
          False behaves the same as RECURSE if recurse_skipped is True, or
          SKIP otherwise.

      If include_self is True (the default), this file (a.k.a. self) will be
      yielded as well (if it matches the specified filter function). If it's
      False, only this file's children (and their children, and so on) will
      be yielded.

   .. method:: rename_to(self, other)

      Rename this file or folder to the specified name, which should be
      another file object (but need not be of the same type as self).

      The default implementation simply does::

          self.copy_to(other)
          self.delete()

      (which, as a note, doesn't work for directories yet, so at present
      directories can't be renamed across different subclasses). Subclasses
      are free to provide a more specialized implementation for renames to
      files of the same type; File and SSHFile, for example, make use of
      native functions to speed up such renames (and to allow them to work
      with directories at present).

   .. method:: safe_child(self, *names)

      Same as self.child(*names), but checks that the resulting file is a
      descendant of self. If it's not, an exception will be thrown. This
      allows unsanitized paths to be used without fear that things like ".."
      will be used to escape the confines of self.

      The pathname may contain occurrences of ".." so long as they do not
      escape self. For example, "a/b/../c" is perfectly fine, but "a/../.."
      is not.

   .. method:: same_as(self, other)

      Returns True if this file represents the same file as the specified
      one, False otherwise.

      This is usually the same as self == other, but URL implements this
      differently: a URL with a trailing slash and a URL without are treated
      as the same by same_as but different by ==.

      The default implementation returns True if self.path_components ==
      other.path_components and type(self) == type(other), or False otherwise.
       

   .. method:: sibling(self, *names)

      Returns a File object representing the sibling of this file with the
      specified name. This is equivalent to self.parent.child(name).

   .. attribute:: size

      The size, in bytes, of this file. This is the number of bytes that the
      file contains; the number of actual bytes of disk space it consumes is
      usually larger.

      If this file is actually a folder, the sizes of its child files and
      folders will be recursively summed up and returned. This can take quite
      some time for large folders.

      This is the same as len(self).

   .. attribute:: type

      The type of this file. This can be one of FILE, FOLDER, or LINK (I
      don't yet have constants for block/character special devices; those
      will come soon.) If the file does not exist, this should be None.

   .. attribute:: valid

      True if this file/folder exists, False if it doesn't. This will be
      False for broken symbolic links; use self.exists if you want an
      alternative that returns True for broken symbolic links.

   .. method:: write(self, data, binary=True)

      Overwrite this file with the specified data. After this is called,
      self.size will be equal to len(data), and self.read() will be equal to
      data. If you want to append data instead, use self.append().

      If binary is True (the default), the file will be written
      byte-for-byte. If it's False, the file will be written in text mode. 

---------------
Class DiskUsage
---------------

Disk space and inode usage.

Instances of this class are typically obtained from MountPoint.usage.

.. class:: DiskUsage(self, space, inodes)



   .. method:: __repr__(self)
               __str__(self)



   .. attribute:: inodes

      An instance of Usage indicating utilization of inodes, or None on
      platforms (like Windows) that don't have such a concept.

   .. attribute:: space

      An instance of Usage indicating utilization of disk space.

----------------
Class FileSystem
----------------

An abstract class representing an entire file system hierarchy.

Instances of this class are typically obtained by directly instantiating
its subclasses. The most commonly used subclass, LocalFileSystem, maintains
a singleton instance that corresponds to the filesystem of the local
machine. Other subclasses include SSHFileSystem.

.. class:: FileSystem

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: child(self, path)

      Return an instance of BaseFile representing the file located at the
      specific path. 

   .. attribute:: mountpoints

      A list of MountPoint instances corresponding to all mount points on the
      system.

      On Windows, there will be exactly one mount point for each drive
      letter. On POSIX systems, there will be one mount point per, well,
      mount point.

   .. attribute:: roots

      A list of all of the file system hierarchy roots exposes by this
      FileSystem instance.

      On Windows, there will be one root per drive letter. On POSIX systems,
      there will be exactly one root, namely '/'.

-----------------
Class MountDevice
-----------------

A device as mounted under a particular mount point.

Note: The API of this class is still in flux. I'm particularly considering
splitting it into two classes whose names are yet to be decided, one of
which will contain every property except subpath and the other of which
will contain two properties, subpath and device, the latter pointing to an
instance of the former class. Bear this in mind when writing code that uses
this class.

.. class:: MountDevice

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. attribute:: device

      A textual representation of this device, if the subclass exposes such
      information.

      If self.location is not None, this will be self.location.path.

      On Linux, for special file system types, this will be the name of the
      type in question; 'tmpfs', for example.

   .. attribute:: location

      The location of this device as a BaseFile instance, if the subclass
      exposes mount point devices in the form of a file in the file system
      hierarchy. On Linux, for example, this might be something like
      File('/dev/sda1'). On Windows this will be None, and it will also be
      None on Linux for special file systems like tmpfs that don't have any
      representation in the file system hierarchy.

   .. attribute:: subpath

      The subpath, as a string containing an absolute path, of the file
      system located on this device being exposed to the mount point on which
      this device is mounted, or None if the subclass doesn't support such a
      notion.

      For most mount devices that support this, this will just be "/". It can
      be a different path when a nested path within a particular file system
      is exposed with a bind mount; in such a case, this is the path within
      the file system being exposed at the mount point on which this device
      is mounted.

----------------
Class MountPoint
----------------

An abstract class representing mount points on a file system.

Instances of this class can be obtained from BaseFile.mountpoint, a
property that returns the MountPoint instance on which the file in question
resides. They can also be obtained from FileSystem.mountpoints, a property
that returns a list of all of the system's mount points.

.. class:: MountPoint

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. attribute:: available_space



   .. attribute:: device

      An instance of MountDevice representing the topmost device currently
      mounted at this mount point. This is the device whose data is currently
      available at this mount point.

      This is just short for self.devices[-1], but if self.devices is empty,
      None will be returned instead.

   .. attribute:: devices

      A list of instances of MountDevice representing all of the devices
      currently mounted at this mount point, in the order in which they were
      attached. The last of these is the device whose data is currently
      available at this mount point.

      Not all systems support stacks of devices mounted at the same
      mount point. For systems that don't support this, there will never be
      more than one device mounted at any given mount point. For systems that
      do (such as Linux), unmounting a mount point simply causes the last
      device attached to the mount point to be popped off the stack, and the
      next device's data is made available at that mount point.

   .. attribute:: filesystem

      The FileSystem instance on which this mount point resides.

   .. attribute:: free_space



   .. attribute:: location

      The BaseFile instance indicating the directory at which this mount
      point is mounted.

   .. attribute:: total_space



   .. method:: unmount(self, force=True)

      Unmount the topmost device attached to this mountpoint.

   .. attribute:: usage

      An instance of DiskUsage indicating the current disk and inode usage
      for this mount point.

   .. attribute:: used_space



-----------
Class Usage
-----------

Usage of a particular file system resource, such as disk space (given in
bytes) or inodes.

.. class:: Usage(self, total, used, available)



   .. method:: __repr__(self)



   .. attribute:: available

      Amount of free disk space or number of inodes available to the current
      user.

      This is often the same as self.free, but things like disk space quotas
      and blocks reserved for the superuser can make it have a value less
      than that of self.free.

   .. attribute:: free

      Amount of disk space or number of inodes not currently in use.

   .. attribute:: total

      Total amount of disk space or inodes available.

   .. attribute:: used

      Amount of disk space or number of inodes currently in use.
