---------------
Class Hierarchy
---------------



.. class:: Hierarchy

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: __div__(self, other)

      An absolutely pointless and unnecessary alias for self.child(other)
      that exists solely because I was overly bored one night while working
      on fileutils.

   .. method:: ancestor_of(self, other, including_self=False)

      Returns true if this file is an ancestor of the specified file. A file
      is an ancestor of another file if that other file's parent is (as
      decided by :obj:`~same_as`) this file, or its parent's parent is this
      file, and so on.

      If including_self is True, the file is considered to be an ancestor of
      itself, i.e. True will be returned in the case that self.same_as(other).
      Otherwise, only the file's immediate parent, and its parent's parent,
      and so on are considered to be ancestors.

   .. attribute:: ancestors

      A list of all of the ancestors of this file, with self.parent first.

      This property simply returns
      :obj:`self.get_ancestors() <get_ancestors>`. Have a look at that
      method if you need to do more complex things like include self as one
      of the returned ancestors.

   .. method:: child(self, *names)

      Returns a file object representing the child of this file with the
      specified name. If multiple names are present, they will be joined
      together. If no names are present, self will be returned.

      If any names are absolute, all names before them (and self) will be
      discarded. Relative names (like "..") are also allowed. If you want a
      method that guarantees that the result is a child of self, use
      self.safe_child(...).

      This method is analogous to
      :obj:`os.path.join(self.path, *names) <os.path.join>`.

   .. method:: descendant_of(self, other, including_self=False)

      Returns true if this file is a descendant of the specified file. This
      is equivalent to other.ancestor_of(self, including_self).

   .. method:: get_ancestors(self, including_self=False)

      Returns a list of all of the ancestors of this file, with self.parent
      first. If including_self is True, self will be first, self.parent will
      be second, and so on.

   .. method:: get_path(self, relative_to=None, separator=None)

      Gets the path to the file represented by this File object.

      If relative_to is specified, the returned path will be a relative path,
      the path of this file relative to the specified one. Otherwise, the
      returned path will be absolute.

      If separator (which must be a string) is specified, it will be used as
      the separator to place between path components in the returned path.
      Otherwise, os.path.sep will be used as the separator.

   .. method:: get_path_components(self, relative_to=None)

      Returns a list of the components in this file's path, including (on
      POSIX-compliant systems) an empty leading component for absolute paths.

      If relative_to is specified, the returned set of components will
      represent a relative path, the path of this file relative to the
      specified one. Otherwise, the returned components will represent an
      absolute path.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of this file. For example, File("a", "b", "c").name will be
      "c".

      On Unix-based operating systems, File("/").name will be the empty
      string.

   .. attribute:: parent

      Returns a file representing the parent of this file. If this file has
      no parent (for example, if it's "/" on Unix-based operating systems or
      a drive letter on Windows), None will be returned.

   .. attribute:: path

      The absolute path to the file represented by this file object, in a
      format native to the type of file in use. For instances of
      fileutils.local.File, this pathname can be used with Python's
      traditional file-related utilities.

      This property simply returns self.get_path(). See the documentation for
      that method for more complex ways of creating paths (including
      obtaining relative paths).

   .. attribute:: path_components

      A property that simply returns
      :obj:`self.get_path_components() <get_path_components>`.

   .. method:: safe_child(self, *names)

      Same as self.child(*names), but checks that the resulting file is a
      descendant of self. If it's not, an exception will be thrown. This
      allows unsanitized paths to be used without fear that things like ".."
      will be used to escape the confines of self.

      The pathname may contain occurrences of ".." so long as they do not
      escape self. For example, "a/b/../c" is perfectly fine, but "a/../.."
      is not.

   .. method:: same_as(self, other)

      Returns True if this file represents the same file as the specified
      one, False otherwise.

      This is usually the same as self == other, but URL implements this
      differently: a URL with a trailing slash and a URL without are treated
      as the same by same_as but different by ==.

      The default implementation returns True if self.path_components ==
      other.path_components and type(self) == type(other), or False otherwise.
       

   .. method:: sibling(self, *names)

      Returns a File object representing the sibling of this file with the
      specified name. This is equivalent to self.parent.child(name).

--------------
Class Listable
--------------



*Method resolution order:* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable`

.. class:: Listable

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. attribute:: child_names

      A list of the names of all of the children of this file, as a list of
      strings. If this file is not a folder, the value of this property is
      None.

   .. attribute:: children

      A list of all of the children of this file, as a list of File objects.
      If this file is not a folder, the value of this property is None.

   .. method:: recurse(self, filter=None, include_self=True, recurse_skipped=True)

      A generator that recursively yields all child File objects of this file.
      Files and directories (and the files and directories contained within
      them, and so on) are all included.

      A filter function accepting one argument can be specified. It will be
      called for each file and folder. It can return one of True, False,
      SKIP, YIELD, or RECURSE, with the behavior of each outlined in the
      following table::
          
                                Don't yield   Do yield
                              +-------------+----------+
          Don't recurse into  | SKIP        | YIELD    |
                              +-------------+----------+
          Do recurse into     | RECURSE     | True     |
                              +-------------+----------+
          
          False behaves the same as RECURSE if recurse_skipped is True, or
          SKIP otherwise.

      If include_self is True (the default), this file (a.k.a. self) will be
      yielded as well (if it matches the specified filter function). If it's
      False, only this file's children (and their children, and so on) will
      be yielded.

Class ReadWrite
---------------



*Method resolution order:* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable`, :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Writable`

.. class:: ReadWrite

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: rename_to(self, other)

      Rename this file or folder to the specified name, which should be
      another file object (but need not be of the same type as self).

      The default implementation simply does::

          self.copy_to(other)
          self.delete()

      (which, as a note, doesn't work for directories yet, so at present
      directories can't be renamed across different subclasses). Subclasses
      are free to provide a more specialized implementation for renames to
      files of the same type; File and SSHFile, for example, make use of
      native functions to speed up such renames (and to allow them to work
      with directories at present).

--------------
Class Readable
--------------



.. class:: Readable

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: check_file(self)

      Checks to see whether this File refers to a file. If it doesn't, an
      exception will be thrown.

   .. method:: check_folder(self)

      Checks to see whether this File refers to a folder. If it doesn't, an
      exception will be thrown.

   .. method:: copy_into(self, other, overwrite=False)

      Copies this file to an identically named file inside the specified
      folder. This is just shorthand for self.copy_to(other.child(self.name))
      which, from experience, seems to be by far the most common use case for
      the copy_to function.

      The newly-created file in the specified folder will be returned as per
      other.child(self.name).

   .. method:: copy_to(self, other, overwrite=False)

      Copies the contents of this file to the specified File object or
      pathname. An exception will be thrown if the specified file already
      exists and overwrite is False.

      This `does not currently work for folders
      <https://github.com/javawizard/fileutils/issues/1>`_;
      I hope to add this ability in the near future.

      This also does not currently preserve file attributes or permissions;
      such abilities will be added soon.

   .. method:: dereference(self, recursive=False)

      Dereference the symbolic link represented by this file and return a
      File object pointing to the symbolic link's referent.

      If recursive is False, a File object pointing directly to the referent
      will be returned. If recursive is True, the referent itself will be
      recursively dereferenced, and the returned File will be guaranteed not
      to be a link.

      If this file is not a symbolic link, self will be returned.

   .. attribute:: exists

      True if this file/folder exists, False if it doesn't. This will be True
      even for broken symbolic links; use self.valid if you want an
      alternative that returns False for broken symbolic links.

   .. method:: hash(self, algorithm=<built-in function openssl_md5>, return_hex=True)

      Compute the hash of this file and return it, as a hexidecimal string.

      The default algorithm is md5. An alternate constructor from hashlib
      can be passed as the algorithm parameter; file.hash(hashlib.sha1)
      would, for example, compute the SHA-1 hash instead.

      If return_hex is False (it defaults to True), the hash object itself
      will be returned instead of the return value of its hexdigest() method.
      One can use this to access the binary hash instead.

   .. attribute:: is_broken

      True if this File is a symbolic link that is broken, False if it isn't.
      A symbolic link that points to a broken symbolic link is itself
      considered to be broken.

   .. attribute:: is_directory

      Same as self.is_folder.

   .. attribute:: is_file

      True if this File is a file, False if it isn't. If the file/folder
      doesn't actually exist yet, this will be False.

      If this file is a symbolic link that points to a file, this will be
      True.

   .. attribute:: is_folder

      True if this File is a folder, False if it isn't. If the file/folder
      doesn't actually exist yet, this will be False.

      If this file is a symbolic link that points to a folder, this will be
      True.

   .. attribute:: is_link

      True if this File is a symbolic link, False if it isn't. This will be
      True even for broken symbolic links.

   .. attribute:: link_target

      Returns the target to which this file, which is expected to be a
      symbolic link, points, as a string. If this file is not a symbolic
      link, None is returned.

      Subclasses (such as URL) without a well-defined notion of symbolic
      links are free to interpret this as they wish; URL, for example,
      presents as a link any URL which sends back an HTTP redirect.

   .. method:: open_for_reading(self)

      Open this file for reading in binary mode and return a Python file-like
      object from which this file's contents can be read.

   .. method:: read(self)

      Read the contents of this file and return them as a string. This is
      usually a bad idea if the file in question is large, as the entire
      contents of the file will be loaded into memory.

   .. method:: read_blocks(self, block_size=None)

      A generator that yields successive blocks of data from this file. Each
      block will be no larger than block_size bytes, which defaults to 16384.
      This is useful when reading/processing files larger than would
      otherwise fit into memory.

      One could implement, for example, a copy function thus::

          with target.open("wb") as target_stream:
              for block in source.read_blocks():
                  target_stream.write(block)

   .. attribute:: size

      The size, in bytes, of this file. This is the number of bytes that the
      file contains; the number of actual bytes of disk space it consumes is
      usually larger.

      If this file is actually a folder, the sizes of its child files and
      folders will be recursively summed up and returned. This can take quite
      some time for large folders.

      This is the same as len(self).

   .. attribute:: type

      The type of this file. This can be one of FILE, FOLDER, or LINK (I
      don't yet have constants for block/character special devices; those
      will come soon.) If the file does not exist, this should be None.

   .. attribute:: valid

      True if this file/folder exists, False if it doesn't. This will be
      False for broken symbolic links; use self.exists if you want an
      alternative that returns True for broken symbolic links.

----------------------
Class WorkingDirectory
----------------------



.. class:: WorkingDirectory

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. attribute:: as_working

      A property that returns a context manager. This context manager sets
      the working directory to self upon being entered and restores it to
      what it previously was upon being exited. One can use this to replace
      something like::

          old_dir = File()
          new_dir.cd()
          try:
              ...stuff...
          finally:
              old_dir.cd()

      with the much nicer::

          with new_dir.as_working:
              ...stuff...

      and get exactly the same effect.

      The context manager's __enter__ returns self (this file), so you can
      also use an "as" clause on the with statement to get access to the
      file in case you haven't got it stored in a variable anywhere.

   .. method:: cd(self)

      An alias for :obj:`self.change_to() <change_to>`.

   .. method:: change_to(self)

      Sets the current working directory to self.

      Since File instances internally store paths in absolute form, other
      File instances will continue to work just fine after this is called.

      If you need to restore the working directory at any point, you might
      want to consider using :obj:`self.as_working <as_working>` instead.

--------------
Class Writable
--------------



.. class:: Writable

   x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature

   .. method:: append(self, data)

      Append the specified data to the end of this file.

   .. method:: create_folder(self, ignore_existing=False, recursive=False)

      Creates the folder referred to by this File object. If it already
      exists but is not a folder, an exception will be thrown. If it already
      exists and is a folder, an exception will be thrown if ignore_existing
      is False (the default); if ignore_existing is True, no exception will
      be thrown.

      If the to-be-created folder's parent does not exist and recursive is
      False, an exception will be thrown. If recursive is True, the folder's
      parent, its parent's parent, and so on will be created automatically.

   .. method:: delete(self, ignore_missing=False)

      Deletes this file or folder, recursively deleting children if
      necessary.

      The contents parameter has no effect, and is present for backward
      compatibility.

      If the file does not exist and ignore_missing is False, an exception
      will be thrown. If the file does not exist but ignore_missing is True,
      this function simply does nothing.

      Note that symbolic links are never recursed into, and are instead
      themselves removed.

   .. method:: link_to(self, target)

      Creates this file as a symbolic link pointing to other, which can be
      a pathname or an object of the same type as self. Note that if it's a
      pathname, a symbolic link will be created with the exact path
      specified; it will therefore be absolute if the path is absolute or
      relative (to the link itself) if the path is relative. If an object of
      the same type as self, however, is used, the symbolic link will always
      be absolute.

   .. method:: mkdir(self, silent=False)

      An alias for self.create_folder(ignore_existing=silent).

   .. method:: mkdirs(self, silent=False)
               makedirs(self, silent=False)

      An alias for self.create_folder(ignore_existing=silent, recursive=True).

   .. method:: open_for_writing(self, append=False)

      Open this file for reading in binary mode and return a Python file-like
      object from which this file's contents can be read.

      If append is False, the file's contents will be erased and the returned
      stream positioned at the beginning of the (now empty) file. If append
      is True, the file's contents will not be erased, and the returned
      stream will be positioned at the end of the file.

      Note that some implementations (currently only SMBFile) don't have
      native support for writing files remotely; support in such
      implementations can be emulated by returning a wrapper around a
      temporary file that, when closed, uploads itself to the location of
      the file to be written. As a result, objects returned from
      open_for_writing should be closed before calling open_for_reading on
      the same file.

   .. method:: write(self, data, binary=True)

      Overwrite this file with the specified data. After this is called,
      self.size will be equal to len(data), and self.read() will be equal to
      data. If you want to append data instead, use self.append().

      If binary is True (the default), the file will be written
      byte-for-byte. If it's False, the file will be written in text mode.
