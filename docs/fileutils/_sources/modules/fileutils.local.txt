.. class:: File(self, *path_components)

   Creates a new file from the specified path components. Each component
   represents the name of a folder or a file. These are internally joined
   as if by os.path.join(*path_components).

   It's also possible, although not recommended, to pass a full pathname
   (in the operating system's native format) into File. On Windows, one
   could therefore do File(r"C:\some\file"), and File("/some/file") on
   Linux and other Unix operating systems.

   You can also call File(File(...)). This is equivalent to File(...) and
   exists to make it easier for functions to accept either a pathname or
   a File object.

   Passing no arguments (i.e. File()) results in a file that refers to the
   working directory as of the time the File instance was constructed.

   Pathnames are internally stored in absolute form; as a result, changing
   the working directory after creating a File instance will not change
   the file referred to.

   .. method:: __cmp__(self, other)



   .. method:: __hash__(self)



   .. method:: __nonzero__(self)

      Returns True. File objects are always true values; to test for their
      existence, use self.exists instead.

   .. method:: __str__(self)
               __repr__(self)



   .. method:: change_to(self)

      Sets the current working directory to self.

      Since File instances internally store paths in absolute form, other
      File instances will continue to work just fine after this is called.

      If you need to restore the working directory at any point, you might
      want to consider using :obj:`self.as_working <as_working>` instead.

   .. method:: create_folder(self, ignore_existing=False, recursive=False)

      Creates the folder referred to by this File object. If it already
      exists but is not a folder, an exception will be thrown. If it already
      exists and is a folder, an exception will be thrown if ignore_existing
      is False (the default); if ignore_existing is True, no exception will
      be thrown.

      If the to-be-created folder's parent does not exist and recursive is
      False, an exception will be thrown. If recursive is True, the folder's
      parent, its parent's parent, and so on will be created automatically.

      |  *Overrides* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Writable.create_folder` *in class* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Writable`

   .. method:: delete(self, contents=False, ignore_missing=False)

      Deletes this file or folder, recursively deleting children if
      necessary.

      The contents parameter has no effect, and is present for backward
      compatibility.

      If the file does not exist and ignore_missing is False, an exception
      will be thrown. If the file does not exist but ignore_missing is True,
      this function simply does nothing.

      Note that symbolic links are never recursed into, and are instead
      themselves removed.

      |  *Overrides* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Writable.delete` *in class* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Writable`

   .. attribute:: delete_on_exit

      A boolean indicating whether or not this file (which may be a file or a
      folder) should be deleted on interpreter shutdown. This is False by
      default, but may be set to True to request that a particular file be
      deleted on exit, and potentially set back to False to cancel such a
      request.

      Note that such files are not absolutely guaranteed to be deleted on
      exit. Deletion is handled via an :obj:`atexit` hook, so files will not be
      deleted if, for example, the interpreter crashes or os._exit() is
      called.

      The value of this property is shared among all File instances pointing
      to a given path. For example::

          File("test").delete_on_exit = True # Instance 1
          print File("test").delete_on_exit # Instance 2, prints "True"

   .. method:: get_path_components(self, relative_to=None)



      |  *Overrides* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Hierarchy.get_path_components` *in class* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Hierarchy`

   .. method:: glob(self, glob)

      Expands the specified path relative to self and returns a list of all
      matching files, as File objects. This is a thin wrapper around a call
      to Python's glob.glob function.

   .. attribute:: link_target

      Returns the target to which this file, which is expected to be a
      symbolic link, points, as a string. If this file is not a symbolic
      link, None is returned.

      |  *Overrides* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable.link_target` *in class* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable`

   .. method:: link_to(self, other)

      Creates this file as a symbolic link pointing to other, which can be
      a pathname or a File object. Note that if it's a pathname, a symbolic
      link will be created with the exact path specified; it will therefore
      be absolute if the path is absolute or relative (to the link itself) if
      the path is relative. If a File object, however, is used, the symbolic
      link will always be absolute.

   .. method:: open(self, *args, **kwargs)

   .. method:: open_for_writing(self, append=False)

   .. attribute:: size

      The size, in bytes, of this file. This is the number of bytes that the
      file contains; the number of actual bytes of disk space it consumes is
      usually larger.

      If this file is actually a folder, the sizes of its child files and
      folders will be recursively summed up and returned. This can take quite
      some time for large folders.

   .. attribute:: type



      |  *Overrides* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable.type` *in class* :obj:`~fileutils.interface.Readable`

   .. method:: unzip_into(self, folder)

      Unzips the zip file referred to by self into the specified folder,
      which will be automatically created (as if by File(folder).mkdirs())
      if it does not yet exist.

      NOTE: This is an unsafe operation! The same warning present on Python's
      zipfile.ZipFile.extractall applies here, namely that a maliciously
      crafted zip file could cause absolute filesystem paths to be
      overwritten. I hope to hand-roll my own extraction code in the future
      that will explicitly filter out absolute paths.

      The return value of this function is File(folder).

   .. method:: zip_into(self, filename, contents=True)

      Creates a zip archive of this folder and writes it to the specified
      filename, which can be either a pathname or a File object.

      If contents is True (the default), the files (and folders, and so on
      recursively) contained within this folder will be written directly to
      the zip file. If it's False, the folder will be written itself. The
      difference is that, given a folder foo which looks like this::

          foo/
              bar
              baz/
                  qux

      Specifying contents=False will result in a zip file whose contents look
      something like::

          zipfile.zip/
              foo/
                  bar
                  baz/
                      qux

      Whereas specifying contents=True will result in this::

          zipfile.zip/
              bar
              baz/
                  qux

      NOTE: This has only been tested on Linux. I still need to test it on
      Windows to make sure pathnames are being handled correctly.

Functions

.. function:: create_temporary_folder(suffix='', prefix='tmp', parent=None, delete_on_exit=False)

   Creates a folder (with tmpfile.mkdtemp) with the specified prefix, suffix,
   and parent folder (or the current platform's default temporary directory if
   no parent is specified) and returns a File object pointing to it.

   If delete_on_exit is True, the returned file's delete_on_exit property will
   be set to True just before returning it.
