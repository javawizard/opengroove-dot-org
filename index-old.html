<b>This is Alexander Boyd's website.</b> Alex is frequently known online as <b>javawizard2539</b>, <b>javawizard</b>, or <b>jcp</b>. There's not much to see here at the moment. Email me at <i>alex<!--comment-->@<!--comment-->opengroove.org</i> or <i>javawizard<!--comment-->@trivergia<!--comment-->.com</i> with any questions. Or you can check out my blog <a href="http://me.opengroove.org">here</a>. I'll have more stuff up here soon. And yeah, I can't really decide whether I'm writing this in first-person or third-person, so just take it as a fact that I'm going to be randomly switching between the two.</br></br>

I used to have a list of my favorite quotes up here. I'm currently dealing with a corrupted database, however, so the quotes list isn't functional right now.<br/><br/>

This website runs on phenoxydine, spiro, and aster, three servers in Alex's basement. There's a photo of phenoxydine <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30702051&l=67fb0cd38f&id=1192582674">here</a>. Spiro and aster are located to the lower left of that picture, out of sight. I'll get pictures of them up soon.<br/><br/>

This was formerly the home of the OpenGroove project, hence the website name. OpenGroove was created a couple of years back by Alex. OpenGroove itself has since been discontinued as a result of Google Wave coming out; Alex now uses OpenGroove as an umbrella organization for many of the projects he writes, such as Android apps. The old OpenGroove website is still available <a href="http://old.opengroove.org">here</a>.
